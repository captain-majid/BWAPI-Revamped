# Intro: :parachute:
We‚Äôre going to talk about BWAPI AI, or as I prefer to call it UDAI (User-Defined AI). Ever wanted to practice vs tough AI offline ? have Internet problems ? want to watch UDAI kill UDAI ? or UDAI kill 1 or 2 built-in AI ? or UDAI kill you :skull: :joy: ? want to see a new world of StarCraft from above ?

Unfortunately, some people still follow ancient methods dealing with BWAPI (the most viewed vid about BWAPI is very old and very confusing and very limited !!!), with BWAPI Revamped, u just extract a compressed file, double click an icon, and BAM! u r in BWAPI !
BWAPI was very hard to configure before **`Revamped`**, many people were having a lot of headaches (even BWAPI AI developers) just to play one game with a specific AI.

If you‚Äôre a player/developer, BWAPI Revamped should give you a comprehensive idea of what BWAPI can do, it has alot of amazing features which **`adds more fun & fun-ctionality not in the pain-in-the-nick normal setup of BWAPI`** (please note that BWAPI.dll itself is the same in the normal setup as in Revamped, think of Revamped as an IDE that integrates a lot of things in 1 and removes all the clutter/confusing things, like 5 in 1 product that makes our life much easier).

# So, what BWAPI/Revamped allows us to do: :rocket:
- Import your SCR hotkeys to v16 with one click üñ±Ô∏è elegantly (no other tool/launcher do that).
- Start SCR directly without Blizzard's launcher (ofc BWAPI doesn't exist in SCR, but this can be useful if Bnet launcher button says ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù, but you just want to run the game quickly instead of waiting for the update or have no Internet connection at all)
- Practice vs tough AI offline in an easy, automated way.
- Create games between UDAI vs 1,2 or 3 Blizzard AI, and see who wins.
- Create games between 2 or more UDAIs and watch the battle safely :popcorn:.
- Load a single player saved game, and let a UDAI take control and play instead of you, to see how it reacts in this specific situation.
- Save a multiplayer game with a UDAI, if something goes wrong, you can go back to a previously saved point, then rinse &amp; repeat.
- Run multiple instances of the game (even more than 8) and control all of them from the same Windows/PC. (you can make a full tech PvZ while controlling the 2 races/instances, this helps testing thing like how damage works under Dark Swarm, etc‚Ä¶ very easily, without a practice partner)
- When YOU play a multiplayer match vs UDAI, not just watch live from the UDAI instance what the UDAI is doing from its pov, but you can also stop/pause the game or modify the action, spying on an AI isn‚Äôt cheating, right?
- Various useful plugins of ChaosLauncher like APMAlert which shows game timer, local time, APM. Also for replays, there are 2 other amazing plugins:
  - **Resolution Expander**: https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/issues/838
  - **HotkeySelector**: shows you live if hotkeys from 0:9 are assigned to something for all players, so you can easliy know the hotkey setup of them.
- Do cool things like, increase game speed above 24 FPS (imagine running the game @500 FPS or more), this makes you bypass boring steps during gameplay, like when watching 2 UDAI fighting, or 1 UDAI vs Blizzard AI, or maybe just to test specific things quickly, CoachAI allows you increase/decrease game speed easily using hotkeys like PgUp/PgDn, Home/End, you can practice playing @ let‚Äôs say 30 FPS, to push your self to the limits, thus playing @24FPS will be a piece of cake.
- Use it as an AI-practice-partner that do what you ask, a lot of UDAIs allow us to configure a specific BO for a specific MU, so if you want to play vs 3hh, bbs, DT drop, 4 Gate goon, 4 pool, etc‚Ä¶, your AI-practice-partner will happily do this 4u anytime, no Internet issues, no bm, no TZ differences, nothing‚Ä¶ This can be also done in an online multiplayer - ICCUP (not a ladder game ofc, just ums or so)‚Ä¶ I can organize a specific MU/BO for both of you if you like.
- **BWAPI Revamped** already includes [**CoachAI**](https://github.com/captain-majid/CoachAI), which is amazing for game practice, amazing for replay analysis.
Play vs old UDAIs that target old versions of BWAPI like v3.7.5.
